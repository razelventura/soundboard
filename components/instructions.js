Welcome to Soundboard! 

You can play a pre-loaded sound as a sound effect for your casual conversations. 

You can record your own sounds and play them back. Just tap to play or stop the sound.

Don't like the recording? Long press to delete. 

You can also use this app like a looper. You can play multiple sounds at the same time while they loop! 

You can switch off / on the loop playback options using the toggle switch. Just remember to stop all playing sounds before changing the loopback setting.

Have fun!
